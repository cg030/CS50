Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With increasing N the probabilities vary less. With increasing N the real run time increases.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
After 1000 simulations the predictions should be good enough.
